# Face-detection-with-Deep-Learning

A number of deep learning methods have been developeed and demonstrated for face detection.

Perhaps one of the more popular approaches is called the *"Multi-Task Cascaded Convolutional Neural Network"* **(MTCNN)** described by [Kaipeng Zhang](https://kpzhang93.github.io/) in the 2016 paper titled "[Joint Face Detection and Alignment Using Multitask Cascaded Convolutional Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.02878)"
